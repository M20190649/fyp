abstract = {In this work, we present methods to estimate average daily origin-destination trips from triangulated mobile phone records of millions of anonymized users. These records are first converted into clustered locations at which users engage in activities for an observed duration. These locations are inferred to be home, work, or other depending on observation frequency, day of week, and time of day, and represent a user's origins and destinations. Since the arrival time and duration at these locations reflect the observed (based on phone usage) rather than true arrival time and duration of a user, we probabilistically infer departure time using survey data on trips in major US cities. Trips are then constructed for each user between two consecutive observations in a day. These trips are multiplied by expansion factors based on the population of a user's home Census Tract and divided by the number of days on which we observed the user, distilling average daily trips. Aggregating individuals' daily trips by Census Tract pair, hour of the day, and trip purpose results in trip matrices that form the basis for much of the analysis and modeling that inform transportation planning and investments. The applicability of the proposed methodology is supported by validation against the temporal and spatial distributions of trips reported in local and national surveys.},

abstract = {Large-scale urban sensing data such as mobile phone traces are emerging as an important data source for urban modeling. This study represents a first step towards building a methodology whereby mobile phone data can be more usefully applied to transportation research. In this paper, we present techniques to extract useful mobility information from the mobile phone traces of millions of users to investigate individual mobility patterns within a metropolitan area. The mobile-phone-based mobility measures are compared to mobility measures computed using odometer readings from the annual safety inspections of all private vehicles in the region to check the validity of mobile phone data in characterizing individual mobility and to identify the differences between individual mobility and vehicular mobility. The empirical results can help us understand the intra-urban variation of mobility and the non-vehicular component of overall mobility. More importantly, this study suggests that mobile phone trace data represent a reasonable proxy for individual mobility and show enormous potential as an alternative and more frequently updatable data source and a compliment to the conventional travel surveys in mobility study. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the huge worldwide mobile-phone penetration is increasingly turning the mobile network into a gigantic ubiquitous sensing platform, enabling large-scale analysis and applications. Recently, mobile data-based research reached important conclusions about various aspects of human mobility patterns. But how accurately do these conclusions reflect the reality? To evaluate the difference between reality and approximation methods, we study in this paper the error between real human trajectory and the one obtained through mobile phone data using different interpolation methods (linear, cubic, nearest interpolations) taking into consideration mobility parameters. Moreover, we evaluate the error between real and estimated load using the proposed interpolation methods. From extensive evaluations based on real cellular network activity data of the state of Massachusetts, we show that, with respect to human trajectories, the linear interpolation offers the best estimation for sedentary people while the cubic one for commuters. Another important experimental finding is that trajectory estimation methods show different error regimes whether used within or outside the "territory" of the user defined by the radius of gyration. Regarding the load estimation error, we show that by using linear and cubic interpolation methods, we can find the positions of the most crowded regions ("hotspots") with a median error lower than 7{\%}. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rapid urbanization is placing increasing stress on already burdened transportation infrastructure. Ubiquitous mobile computing and the massive data it generates presents new opportunities to measure the demand for this infrastructure, diagnose problems, and plan for the future. However, before these benefits can be realized, methods and models must be updated to integrate these new data sources into existing urban and transportation planning frameworks for estimating travel demand and infrastructure usage. While recent work has made great progress extracting valid and useful measurements from new data resources, few present end-to-end solutions that transform and integrate raw, massive data into estimates of travel demand and infrastructure performance. Here we present a flexible, modular, and computationally efficient software system to fill this gap. Our system estimates multiple aspects of travel demand using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile phones in conjunction with open- and crowdsourced geospatial data, census records, and surveys. We bring together numerous existing and new algorithms to generate representative origin-destination matrices, route trips through road networks constructed using open and crowd-sourced data repositories, and perform analytics on the system's output. We also present an online, interactive visualization platform to communicate these results to researchers, policy makers, and the public. We demonstrate the flexibility of this system by performing analyses on multiple cities around the globe. We hope this work will serve as unified and comprehensive guide to integrating new big data resources into customary transportation demand modeling.},

These technologies provide new resources for spatio-temporal data mining and geographic knowledge discovery. Since the development of ICTs also impacts physical movement of individuals in societies, much of the existing research has focused on examining the correlation between ICT and human mobility. In this paper, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of how usage of mobile phones correlates with individual travel behavior by exploring the correlation between mobile phone call frequencies and three indicators of travel behavior: (1) radius, (2) eccentricity, and (3) entropy. The methodology is applied to a large dataset from Harbin city in China. The statistical analysis indicates a significant correlation between mobile phone usage and all of the three indicators. In addition, we examine and demonstrate how explanatory factors, such as age, gender, social temporal orders and characteristics of the built environment, impact the relationship between mobile phone usage and individual activity behavior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mobile networks contain vast repositories of data that store valuable information regarding subscriber behaviour. In this paper, a new approach for subscriber classification in mobile cellular networks is proposed. The proposed approach considers network traffic generated from a mobile cellular network operator in South Africa. The proposed approach makes use of a difference histogram approach for feature extraction and a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to classify traffic data into subscriber classes. To validate the proposed approach, a comparative analysis of two different multi-resolution feature extraction approaches, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach and the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) are compared with results obtained with the difference histogram (DH) approach. It is shown that the difference histogram provides better clustering results when compared to the two multi-resolution approaches demonstrating the potential of the difference histogram approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Excessive land use and suburbanisation around densely populated urban areas has gone hand in hand with a growth in overall transportation and discussions about causality of traffic congestions. The objective of this paper is to gain new insight regarding the composition of traffic flows, and to reveal how and to what extent suburbanites' travelling affects rush hour traffic. We put forward an alternative methodological approach using call detail records of mobile phones to assess the composition of traffic flows during the evening rush hour in Tallinn, Estonia. We found that daily commuting and suburbanites influence transportation demand by amplifying the evening rush hour traffic, although daily commuting trips comprises only 31{\%} of all movement at that time. The geography of the Friday evening rush hour is distinctive from other working days, presumably in connection with domestic tourism and leisure time activities. This suggests that the rise of the overall mobility of individuals due to societal changes may play a greater role in evening rush hour traffic conditions than does the impact of suburbanisation.},

In 5 essence, these data have the potential to supplement most of the outputs from regional travel 6 demand models. Creating new analysis tools may shift the paradigm of how we approach data 7 and modeling when assessing travel demand. Recent work has shown how processed 8 origin-destination trips, as developed by trip data providers, supports travel analysis. Much less 9 is reported on how raw data from telecommunication providers can be processed to support such 10 analysis or to what extent the raw data can be treated to extract travel behavior. This work 11 discusses how cell phone data can be processed to inform a four-step transportation model, 12 focusing specifically on the limitations and opportunities of such data. We show a data treatment 13 pipeline that uses only phone data and population density to generate trip matrices in two 14 Metropolitan areas: Boston and Rio de Janeiro. We detail how to label zones as home and work 15 based on frequency and the time of day. Based on the labels (home, work, or other) of 16 consecutive stays we can assign purposes to trips such as home-based-work. The resulting 17 number of trips pairs are expanded using the total population from census data. We show 18 comparable results with existing information reported in local surveys in Boston and existing 19 origin-destination matrices in Rio de Janeiro. Our results detail a method to use passively 20 generated cellular data as a low cost option for transportation planning.},

@article{AlNuaimi2015,
abstract = {Many governments are considering adopting the smart city concept in their cities and implementing big data applications that support smart city components to reach the required level of sustainability and improve the living standards. Smart cities utilize multiple technologies to improve the performance of health, transportation, energy, education, and water services leading to higher levels of comfort of their citizens. This involves reducing costs and resource consumption in addition to more effectively and actively engaging with their citizens. One of the recent technologies that has a huge potential to enhance smart city services is big data analytics. As digitization has become an integral part of everyday life, data collection has resulted in the accumulation of huge amounts of data that can be used in various beneficial application domains. Effective analysis and utilization of big data is a key factor for success in many business and service domains, including the smart city domain. This paper reviews the applications of big data to support smart cities. It discusses and compares different definitions of the smart city and big data and explores the opportunities, challenges and benefits of incorporating big data applications for smart cities. In addition it attempts to identify the requirements that support the implementation of big data applications for smart city services. The review reveals that several opportunities are available for utilizing big data in smart cities; however, there are still many issues and challenges to be addressed to achieve better utilization of this technology.},

abstract = {In this paper an implementation of a smart predictive monitoring and adaptive control system for the public lighting have been carried out. The vehicular traffic flow acquired using a smart camera has been analyzed and several predictive methods have been studied. Then, a control strategy based on the given traffic forecasts and on the dynamical street class downgrade allowed by the law, has been implemented. Experimental results provided by a real life testbed showed that the proposed strategy has high potential energy savings without affecting safety.},
